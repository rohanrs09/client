To check if your React frontend works properly with your ASP.NET backend, follow these steps:

1. First, start your ASP.NET backend:
   - Navigate to your SHMS backend folder
   - Run the backend using:
     ```
     dotnet run
     ```
   - Note the URL where your API is running (usually http://localhost:5000)

2. Update your API URL in the React app:
   - In `client/src/services/api.js`, the API URL is set to:
     ```javascript
     const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api';
     ```
   - If your backend runs on a different URL, create a `.env` file in the client folder with:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-backend-url/api
     ```

3. Start your React frontend:
   - Navigate to the client folder
   - Run:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - Or double-click the `start.bat` file you created

4. Test the connection:
   - Open the React app (http://localhost:3000)
   - Try to register a new user
   - Check browser console (F12) for any API errors
   - If registration works, try logging in
   - If login works, you should be redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on user role

5. Verify API requests in browser:
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for API requests to your backend
   - Successful requests should return status 200-299

If you encounter connection issues:
- Check that your backend is running and accessible
- Verify CORS is enabled on your ASP.NET backend
- Ensure API endpoints match what your React frontend expects
- Check for any JWT token issues in browser console

For detailed debugging, you can add temporary log statements in your API service:
```javascript
console.log('API URL:', API_URL);
console.log('Making request to:', `${API_URL}/endpoint`);
```
